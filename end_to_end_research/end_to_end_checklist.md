# Machine Learning Project Checklist

## I. Problem Definition & Understanding the Project Scope

- [ ]  Define the problem
- [ ]  Understand the context of the problem
- [ ]  Identify all stakeholders
- [ ]  Understand stakeholder needs, capabilities, and expectations
- [ ]  Define the scope of the project
- [ ]  Identify the desired output
- [ ]  Set measurable objectives
- [ ]  Identify metrics for success
- [ ]  Set targets for these metrics
- [ ]  Identify time constraints
- [ ]  Identify budget constraints
- [ ]  Identify technical constraints

## II. Data Gathering & Preparation

- [ ]  Identify potential data sources
- [ ]  Collect data in a structured format (preferably) or collect data in an unstructured format then ETL into a data warehouse
- [ ]  Store data safely and efficiently in a data warehouse
- [ ]  Handle missing values (imputation, deletion, etc.)
- [ ]  Handle outliers (capping, transformation, etc.)
- [ ]  Handle duplicate entries
- [ ]  Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.)
- [ ]  Normalize/standardize numerical variables
- [ ]  Conduct univariate analysis
- [ ]  Conduct bivariate analysis
- [ ]  Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns
- [ ]  Split data into training, validation, and test sets

## III. Feature Engineering & Selection

- [ ]  Create new features based on domain knowledge
- [ ]  Normalize/standardize features
- [ ]  Use filter methods for feature selection (chi-square test, ANOVA, etc.)
- [ ]  Use wrapper methods for feature selection (backward elimination, forward selection, etc.)
- [ ]  Use embedded methods for feature selection (LASSO, ridge regression, etc.)

## IV. Model Selection & Training

- [ ]  Identify suitable models based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
- [ ]  Train models using the training dataset
- [ ]  Tune hyperparameters using grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.
- [ ]  Monitor training process for overfitting or underfitting
- [ ]  Validate models using the validation dataset

## V. Model Evaluation & Selection

- [ ]  Evaluate models using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.)
- [ ]  Conduct error analysis, if applicable
- [ ]  Select the best performing model based on the evaluations

## VI. Model Optimization & Tuning

- [ ]  Tune hyperparameters using grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.
- [ ]  Apply regularization techniques (L1, L2, dropout, etc.) to prevent overfitting
- [ ]  Perform cross-validation for a robust performance estimate

## VII. Model Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ]  Test the final model on the test dataset
- [ ]  Finalize the model (save the model, version control, etc.)
- [ ]  Prepare necessary software components (APIs, UI, etc.)
- [ ]  Deploy the model in the production environment
- [ ]  Monitor the model's performance
- [ ]  Update/retrain the model based on the performance

## VIII. Project Documentation & Reporting

- [ ]  Document the project objectives, procedures, methodologies, results, and conclusions
- [ ]  Maintain a record of all iterations, evaluations, and decisions
- [ ]  Prepare a report of findings
- [ ]  Present the findings to the stakeholders
- [ ]  Provide actionable insights based on the results

> It's important to remember that while this checklist can serve as a general guide, every machine learning project is unique and may require some specific steps depending on its requirements and constraints.
