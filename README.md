### README.md

This file serves as your repository's front page. It offers an overview of the repository's purpose, contents, and how to navigate or use the resources effectively. It's the first point of contact for anyone exploring your repository.

### datasets

Contains the datasets used in the seminar. This includes `seoul_bike_data.csv` for bike-sharing analysis in Seoul and `world_education_data.csv` for a global education analysis. These datasets are integral for hands-on learning and application of Python in real-world data analysis.

### end_to_end_research

This folder houses materials for conducting comprehensive research projects. It includes `end_to_end.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that guides users through a complete data science project from start to finish, and `end_to_end_checklist.md`, a markdown file providing a checklist to ensure all essential steps of a data science project are covered.

### exploratory_data_analysis

Contains `eda.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This notebook teaches how to perform initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical figures and plots.

### feature_engineering

Hosts `feature_engineering.ipynb`, a notebook dedicated to the process of feature engineering. This involves creating new features from existing data and selecting the most relevant features for modeling, which is crucial in enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms.

### getting_started

This folder is designed for beginners. It contains [First Steps](getting_started/first_steps.ipynb), introducing basic Python concepts and data manipulation techniques, and [Resources](getting_started/resources.ipynb), which lists additional learning resources, tutorials, and guides for Python and data science.

### images

Stores images used in the repository, including the `mdsi_logo.png`. This folder typically contains visuals that are referenced in the notebooks or the README file for illustrative purposes.

### python_basics

This includes [Python Basics Crash Course](python_basics/python_crash_course.ipynb), a notebook offering a crash course on Python basics. It's aimed at those who are new to Python or programming in general, covering fundamental concepts and operations in Python.

Each folder is structured to facilitate a step-by-step learning process, starting from Python basics to more advanced topics in data science.
